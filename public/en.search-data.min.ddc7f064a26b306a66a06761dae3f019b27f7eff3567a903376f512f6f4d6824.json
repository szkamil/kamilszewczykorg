Or put a toy car next to real car, or architectural maquette of a building next to real one. You cannot live in the maquette building, you can’t go shopping in toy car, you know the difference, but why everyone , including me, mixes up models ( opinion of a thing vs real qualities that can be objectively measured). Why do we believe in dogmas then ( all sorts of, like economy , psychology, théorie de xyZ….) can be due to the fact it’s complex vs simple ( toy car vs theory of time travel) one easy to imagine the other not - but in primitive environment we didn’t worry about time travel speed. We wanted to survive. Now take this caveman into the Time Machine and tell him to go to work in Wall Street - he would go crazy - but both the caveman and the bankers have the same genes, except that the caveman maybe a lot more smarter then some of them, but that’s for another topic on if humanity gets smarter or not. But caveman would mistrust the maps and models , he would use reality heuristics. We are baffled by the noise like that caveman and make all sorts of mistakes on this complex system.\nWe use maps and models all the time without knowing\nBy maps I mean maps of terrain but also all kinds of mathematical equasions such as Black-Scholes forumula, theory of efficient market, Freud\u0026rsquo;s theories, etc. Basically the world is random and some theories can fit in for some time period by coincidence.\nWhen cycling using a cycling computer with map function, one day a feature appeared where the device started warning of potholes on a roads - which can be useful for road cyclists. But also appeared warning of dense traffic and most bizzarly of a dog in a certain spot. Someone marked on a map that there is a dog, maybe 2 years back, the dog can be dead by now but you still get the warning of a dog in a certain spot. How much our models and maps are similar, we are using some economic previsions yet we don\u0026rsquo;t expect that one day instead of the dog there can be elefant running from the local circus, and in different spot.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/essais/","title":"My First Blog Post","section":"Docs","content":" Aspiring to be worthy of being a philosopher # I start with # Thoughts flow on various subjects.\nSubjects(to be refutable in K.

And they soften body and mind.\nTechnology trinkets degenerate into true needs and into yoke and slavery in the end\nOn the nature of thought: is thinking been added to human as a device to primarily self-fool ? I came to this thought that when I was in my kitchen cutting up goat cheese as I was peckish, and the cheese slept from my hand, and my body reacted automatically to catch the falling cheese, without my intervention mental — by the time I realised what’s happening, the cheese was already in my hand and I got suprised (I was smoking as well at that moment so I was more receptive ). So we are at least 2 different minds (as Kahnemann wrote in his book ) the primitive one and cognitive one. My theory is this is what makes us different from animals, addition of this second brain 2. In a way, it is the animal Kamil that caught the cheese, the mental Kamil needed more time to undestand it, because more brain cells are required to process this information in a human way, the animal part needs less cells because it runs on heuristics, not analytics and imagination like human 2 part, the higher human. So the only question rests: who is doing thinking, and who executes these results of thinking ? and is thinking not a reverse process (on this later ) ? First let’s define more: when I decide to get up and go to fridge to have a bite of cheese, is it the analytical Kamil doing the decision (I want to go eat cheese because I want to ? Where is this impolse from ? ) or is it the animal Kamil doing the decision (body sends a hormone/singals to brain to feel hungry? ). It is evident that it is the animal Kamil deciding, even if higher Kamil thinks he decided (I decided it is a good idea based on the need for calcium). Even if the body needs calcium, it will send signals so that one is feeling pekish for some specific food - as body knows the food and its compositions. So that agian it is Kamil 1 doing the decision and Kamil 2 rationalizing it backwards to show an illusion of control ? I think that at lest in some cases, it can be proved (need to find a method) to show that the causation is from Kamil 1 to Kamil 2, not the otherwise as everyone seems to thinking, this is counterintuitve, that all the decisions are made by the animal who is only interested in survival, and then makes up all sorts of theories to fool others, because in society one cannot just kill others physically without suffring the counsequences sooner or later) and that is how culture runs. So my thesis is that we are a bunch of monkeys that fool themselves that they are humans because they don-t have a tail, or some other exotic definition on cortex thinkness, etc etc ? . We must be a bunch of apes that went to the apex of animals at this stage.\nJak sie opazymy, to nie dotykamy goracego zelazka znowu, reflexy is umysl 1 bedzie zbyt silny azeby umysl 2 mogl cos zorbic. Co zamierzam powiedziec, ze w fizycznym swiecie ktore sie zadzi ludzimi ale ci na poziomie 1 (from Kaheman thinking fast / slow). Ci na poziomie 2 maja swoje urojone problemy, na przyklad sa w toxycznym zwiazku i w nim pozostaja, a czy jakby w padli w fabryce w cysterne chemikalow toxycznych, i czy be wysoczyla taka osoba czy siedziala w tej beczce, jakby pod wplywem narkotykow (Munger i jego zaba co sie ugotowala bo wode sie powoli podgrzwala)? W fizycznym swiecie nie dotykamy sie ognia reka , ale w swiecie mentalnym robimy to, i pomimo ze sie parzymy dalej tak robimy? Moze swiat umyslowy to taka wielka gra komputerowa, taki wielki RPG zeby nam pomogl zyc jak malpom w tym swiecie ? Malpy ale ulpszone bo bez futra i dodatkowym ‘umyslem’ ktory pomaga im stworzyc bardziej kompleksowe spoloeczenstwa, ite spoleczenstwa maja individualnych (nodes in a network) i to ma efekt covex, tzn. ze kazdy dodatkowa noda ma wplyw exponentalny na jakas charaktersystyke. Wiec te malpy z extra umyslewm beda w stanie ulepszyc im technologie i zyc w technologicznych warunkach, made by humans. Tak czy siak, jest roznica pomiedzy reakcjami umyslu 1 (nie dotykam sie ognia) i umyslu 2 (nie moge sie powstrzymac/oprzec tej reakcji). Wynika z tego ze taki ktory nie moze sie powstrzymac od zlych reakcji - ma A. jakies nieporzadane reakcje (z umyslu 1 ? ) i ktore wie ze mu szkodza B. te reakcje ktore wie ze sa zle - sa silniejsze (albo sa tylko fikcyjnie silniejsze bo - z kad viemy ze wogole nie mozemy sie powstrzymac ? no bo czujemy to ? A co moze jesli w codziennych normalnych reakcjach, umysl podejmuje decyzje (uzywajac jakichs heurystyk, no bo wie ze swiat to chaos i zadne reguly jak wschod slonca co taki sam czas (cycliczny) i poza tym nie wiele wiecej, wiec musi uzywac heurystyk i im wiecej (albo mniej ? bo tylko zle przeszkadaja tym dobrym ? i.e. lepiej jest mniej heurystyk i wszystkie dobre niz wieceij ale z mixem dobre/zle - no bo to jakby mix wody i troche trucizny — cala woda bedzie zla. tak samo z heurystykami - nawej 1 zla moze psuc wszystkie inne, e.g. - wredny sposob zycia bedzie wplywal na wszystko bo podstawowa komunikacja miedzy nodami sieci jest zabuzona przez to ze nikt z chamem nie chce sie zadawac. Wiec mniej heurystyk (ta sama zasada w zyciu ? tylko dobre zeczy i ludzie, nigdy mix bo 1 zla rzec czy czlowiek moze zepsuc cala reszte wiec trzymaj sie z daleka ) OK. to tereaz spowrotoem do watku. Primo jestesmy ulepszonymi malpami z samo-oszukujacym sie dodatkiem jaki jest mozg. Secundo umysl 1, ta malpa z przykladu, podejmuje decyzje w ten sposob jak orangutan na drzewie. Tzn. Jesli orangutan chce banana to go zerwie z drzewa, orangutan nie potrzebuje zadnych teorii o braku magnesu bo pije za duzo kawy itd, on wie ze chce banana i go bierze. W swiecie zwierzat (i czlowieka 1) nie ma kogos kto rozdaje banany bezinteresownie, zawsze bedzie jakis interest dla sprzedawcy bananow w dwoch przypadkach - orangutan numer 2 sprzedawca bananow nie zna pojecia pieniedzy ale moze dawac banana w zamian za sex z orangutenem 1, no bo orangutan czego chce ? females, bananas, securite and that-s all. And humans ? need much more so the banana seller in the version 2 (only humans have brain 2 / the frontal cortex) orangutans don-t have it (so it is the theorzy). Orangutan 2 will be seomeone who sells sophisticated stuff for simple stuff (money) or something (sex, promis of a similar favour) so it will be for instance a banker. Instead of banana banker sells toxic stuff (CDOs, derivatieves of junk, etc) and it is much easier for some banana sellers 2 to fool other orangutans (clients of bankers).\nPopper’s truth seeking - (I add personally - if the world is chaos and we need some theory that works most of the time) . The assumption is A. The truth is something like a 3d tunnel that is inifite between dimensions - this cannot be touched but we can get closer to it by removing false, by seeking wha is not truth, so there is less noise, by removing everything that is not trugth. This way doing science, testing theories and finding them false, brings us closer to truth. But only such theories that can be falsfied, e.e. tested and theoretically found not working, because theory tht is true if either A or B happens, it is.not a theory because there is no test attached to this theory that makes it false. So the theorsies need like test cases from programming, where the theory (program) is tested by another program. The test program will run conditions where such theory (the program) is false and will expect failure, which proves that given some conditions, the theory fails (the program).\nZ wieloma developerami trzeba rozmawiać jak z programem komputerowym tak są wyprani od programowania.

E.G. Advert in TV of Valais, and the slogan Grave dans mon coeur. Then another advert selling cheese or something, also utilising this slogan Grave dans mone coeur and his cheese, so that any thouth about Valais will be automatically and subconscously attached to the concept of monanous area in the southern europe, called Valais. Cette communaute fait partie d autres communetes (Cantons) that make up a country. So that anyoe who thinks Valais will autically have food and the emblematic product auto attached to Valais. So this is the way of adertising, (maybe other things too ), it is sneakly attaching brand, une etiquiette, to another brand, here ‘Valais’ in the context of TV ad that it is worth coming to valais for activities and relaxiation (I personally fully agree ). In some real world examples products are so clesely associated that it is inperceptible, for instance Egipt - the piramides, Paris - le tour d aiffel, Rome - colloseum (where these things are much more than their represenationtions, in different dimensions , why not associating work of art with a city, or a dish ? ) they will rest representations, a model that is always only an approximation of the thing itself. So it is attachinng, or merging, one label with another to create quasi-system of labels, like with it’s own personality, proably due to the effect of non linearity, logarithmic croissance, power Laws, Antifragility, or convexity, or optionality. And these systems which are netowrks of models, has simple nodes that are just individual models. In the end - all are models, nothing is really as it is described due to the model, even human languge being a model , has limitations inherit to the model e.g. difficilty to explain complex feelings, feelings when looking at art, during sex, etc. these cannot be exactly put into words. So it is a limitation of a model, then other models that are approximations, that are in turn based on approximations, and this ends up in power laws. that is each model, prediction, prophecy, depends on other, prior to, models, predictions, prophecies, histories, etc. that the theory is based on, and so it continues, and then each error in model feeds into another, then A, this ends up in power laws since each node is raised to the n 2 B. any small perturbations at the far end of the node, can end up with the effect of tsunami, since each irregurality is also propagated thru the nodes by the power of n2. this might explain to some extent the black swan events (et least their amplitude, but not still how are they formed, how they become, those small irreguralities, is it hasard etc, and if the hasard exist , these are the questions that would need deep deliberation, or beter still, designing empiricial tests and falisify the conjectures , or not, in Popperians sense, I went a bit deeper into the model problem, and would like to even approfondir the philosophical problem (and also phisical, and in many ‘sciences’ those artificial compartements). At any rate Ads are labels on labels, models on models, illusions on illusions, all raised to the power of n , in a sense that each of the models, labels, illusions, is made up of others models etc. that are still. based on predecessors etc. Some of them are even heuristics and this is the overlapping terrain I feel Since we might be building new heuristics that will get falisfied by reality or not, or if they will survive the clash with reality, that is the ultimate test. and if survieves long it become some heuristic, some rule of thumb or folk - lore, etc. If we donàt take heuristic as something in born. It can be old heuristic, but maybe humans build up their own heuristics - eg. don’t touch hot stove as a kid. Since it could not have been in born - the kid had to get burnd, and mother said but the kid didnt learn or care, or was too curious. so we learn for sure by pain, and trial and error like the kid and the stove (or cat). so heuristic can be personal that is learnd by pain. Learned nad followed, e.g. church rules, etc. or inborn - some sort of body animal movement. like when touching hot you will auto retract hand before you think.\nDiversity - you want at work people who look different but think the same or look the same and think different\nNothing we know from having seeing it - the truth is hidden in deep and not accessible to human, only to god. All we can hope is to conjecture and refute. Propose bold theories and have them tested or criticized by others. This is the nature of learning - trying things out, for we know nothing and cannot know a thing as humans we are too limited. Just look at a horse, is he aware that the earth is round ? Could you explain statistics to a horse ? And does he need statistics to survive ? What style diff. Between a human and and horse ? Both animals, still human has this reasoning ability that he uses to explain things post factum ? Is that all ?\nWhy power laws rule in the world ? What is power law, or ‘a law’, or even the word ? It is representaton of a concept. And concept, or conjecture in Popper, is always a model, doxa, maybe because the world is multi dimensional and our brains 3 dimensional ? So maybe they can-t process it as a worm cannot imaigne flying since he lives in 2D world ? So maybe these concepts, of Climate warming, is made of smaller concept, e.g. co2 and link with ocearn, land, temperature, etc. All different sub-theories, and so on recursively ad inifitum maybe. And each of these theories, being doxa as any human theory, is cause of another theory, so they are linked like xmas tree lights, the electrons go from the first bulb, then next and so on. If imaginons each bulb was changing the phase from say starting 50hz and adding + 5 % by such a strange light bulb. So that 50 * 1.05 ‎ = 52,5 and the next bulb 52,5 * 1.05 ‎ = 55,125 and third one 55,125 * 1.05 ‎ = 57,881 which can be written as D being deviation of conjecture from reality D = model ^ prob(error). So that you see a model is always made of smaller models, and those still from smaller models. Therefore A. Any model is not a monolith, but a linear (or a network ? not likely, I think linear is what it is the closest). So each change that affect all the nodes (theories) error rate, has exponential effect so that if one take a function F.error.rate = Prob.of.event ^ delta (prev - current error rate) C. As in humans a group and inividual are competely different animals, so also any model is a complex system, because made from other sub models (see above) so that each model even if well ‘modeled’ will fail to grasp the nature of a model because any levels of sub-models will be considered still as a monolith model where we most of the time how deep the recursive would go to get to the root , or principle (which for Popper didn-t exist (I writie it 2025 and my views migh have changed many times over my life as I tested new teories where most of them were refuted, or failed, so eliminated by nature in a way. So back to the central point - we live in power law universe (universe don-t give a damn what we think about him , and also we are part of him and he part of us, since we are a species of organice creatures living on some planet). What statistical chace is that I (you dear reader) is that you have been born in this planet in your body, and that this is the only time that you will be born, and times go fast so you don’t have that much time to accomplish your task, or finding it which can be the majoritz of the task, the execution being he minority. So go and look for and if your are one of those lucky ones - go and finish your task so after living this planet and your body, you will have satisfaction that you well used the time given you by the universe and that you made the world a little bit better, that you made a positive contribution - in lives of other human beings. And rememeber the power law and the model times model , model squared , which is equal model bis = idiotyzn squared. And one more general point: since a model is root of the errorr rate, what is the root to take , 5 because we estimate tha the theory has 5 causaully linked theories ? what if they are complex system and totally not lenear ? bref it is an estimate. so as the complexity (number of subtheories, like 50 subheories in some complex maths problem or some medical theory vs one that has 3)We see the the more complex the theorz the more exponentially the error rate will rise because the number of sub theories servers as a root of the error rate. I think thats how power loaws work, and that world runs on power laws - world is a mental concept, what do we mean , a forest for a indian, a planet for most , or some edge of galaxy for astonomoer ). So basically this thing ‘world’ this mental concept is made up of infinite number of conjectures, or theories, or laws, or lores, or heuristics, or reflexes. All of this makes up a world, is infietly complex and any law, rule, or theory is oboservation of reocurrence of some event, the cyclicality. E.g. pulsars that cyclically send pulses, kicking someone in an ankle will allways cause the victim to cry, scream, attack, etc. so some laws can be drawn , some theorz of pulsar, and some heuristic about well manners. So these are basic laws and how many are the in our social universe ? inifite amount ? All of this makes the world chaotic and exhibiting power laws (but this is only our oboservation of extreme deviation of wat we are comfortable with). The universe don’t care if we have laws or not, e.g. law gravity will always be more real and winning where possible, any contests. So you see the world is a cosmic soup of ideas, beliefs, heuristics, religious systems, political systems etc and all of thsi can interact in impreddictebale way, by any means known. and if we come up with any ideas used as measures\nPlus vous etez manipulable per media, culture, people around etc. Plus vous etez rentable. parce que vous povez etre manipule en croire des theories stupides like Gender, etc. plus vous serez rentable parce que vous achetez des voitures ‘ecolo’, des frangues la dusieme main, etc. Et etre manipulable c-est etre stupide.

So it is eaing the life, instead of growing and adding to it) and this consumption is like social media posts, it is consuming attention, the modern consumption is attention based, that is, social media platforms lure users and this competiotion of luring the users is the nature of those companies). Going back to the main point - that is consuming the life without diesting, seems to be a good summary of this life of short clicks of attentions that are shoot at social media posts, the look when one woman looks at the dress of ofthers, work and consant distractions, to make us stupid ? to wear us out ? So that we become mindless slaves of the system ? or maybe this is purely mimetic behaviour ?\nL’ignorance engendre plus de confiance que la connaissance. Why is that so ?

Yet an analysis of its mechanism teaches us that nothing of this kind happens. The radio does not argue, although it expresses its physical states, and signals.

But another unexpected thing is that these books are menacing, they are tool of recherche, and most importantly- remind me how little I know. And the more one knows the more unread books one has - as they have higher value than those already red (good books also need to be re read ) The reason we do t learn from history is maybe that each new évènement is different - since the works is mainly random so that knowledge cannot help a lot ?

It’s NOT that talent produces success , it success that produces talent. Success of art, depends on mimetic process. We like art imitating others, to belong to some culture.

It’s strange that I see myself turning slowly and mostly surprising, imperceptibly- into heroes if my past , the figures I aspired to be. It feels like becoming old, because of these figures of mine were old, virtues men. But what if I start a tradition of young virtues men, as an example to follow in life?

Check paradox de hempel Learning playing piano is tinkering too - one keeps playing and trying new things and hearing ( feedback loop ) what works Cahier 2 recherche philosophique\n…the previous screen or file that has the first part of this book broke off so I am continuing here. BTW I do feel that thechology is getting worse, like software and hardware stopped progressing long ago, it is due to monopoly of big tech companies that colluded and corered the market. Bref, continuing here:\nIf you take human language, and look for paradoxes, e.g. All the Cretans are liers, or some other types of circular and other types or unclassified quirks, or, bugs, a common term used in IT sector. So if we take human language, and compare it to computer language, we know that computer languages, being made by someone, because computer language is a special type of program that is an interface between computer chip (oversimplification here for demonstration purpose), this program called computer language can have errors, mistakes, and miscalcualtions, that come out with time and are rectified by programmers. Now if we think of human language in terms of the computer language, our human language can also have built in errors, miscalculations, and irrationalities. For instance the Cretan paradox. The central argument is here, it is the very important point: by looking at the irrationalities as this paradox of Cretan, or some arthmetic irrationalities, or even irrational numbers (mathematics is just another specialistc language, like Latin, or Cobol, today., and is invented by humans, it doesn’t exist in nature that was ready and all laid out. Human developped it, starting from those, who still might use, the numbers 1, 2 and many.So going back, you might think that world is irrational, that things that happen sometimes don-t make sense, an idiot proted for a post, irrational numbers, etc.. Now all of these irrationalities are only in our imagination, or stem from our imagination and knowledge. The nature don’t know nor need maths, theories and even humans. It is the humans who need the nature. So all of those irrationalities are the faults in the Popperian sense Conjectures, that were not refuted, or refuted but still in use since nothing better is in place and the rule works good enough. E.g. When you have atomic clock, prooved by experiment, and then you go fly in jumbo jet for a few hours, and then the clock slows marinally meaning you were in a time machine in micro scale. So even if theory don-t exist and something happens, it only means that the theory correlated with X, this tiem. But since the theory, the conjecture, was never refuted before, means that there is no certainty that it won’t work one day, meaning also the reverse, that there is almost certain that won’t work one day. These are failures not of the nature but of the theories, for the theories, as any models such as maps, or maquettes, are only approximaiton and distoritions of reality, and it will never be possible to put the same details into a scale wiouth shedding and distorting some things. This is the fact, human language are bla blas and sometimes correspond to reality, sometimes even for long time, others not. Same as with nations, species, nature elimanates and experiments with another variation, alleale ? . So men keep making their theories, but it is the nature that has the last word.\nLa teroeme de Godel, is, what I understand, after watching a few videos, is this. I have only a small understanding of Godels philosophy, so dear reader exceuse me if that would be so. On the other note, if a base of a theory, or any part of any interconnected (where one element is connected with other nodes-elements of a mesh, directly, or by one or an infinite number of nodes. )is false, the entire theory is false, it is like putting a poison in a tank of water, even 1 drop of cyande ? will spoil entire water tank. Same with falsness of theory. So back to Godel theory, given that math is imperferct language, in order to fix this illogicalitz, or maybe falsnesness, he propose reduce this into some sort of smaller elemetns that will make this less obvious. It is like having an intricate carpet thrown over a puddle of soft mud. The mud and mosit will eventually transpire through the intricate carpet. So a theory B derived from false (and proven like irrational numbers etc,) that theorz cannot be true, since false + true = false, like with this tank of water and poison. So for me his theory is refuted on the basis that his theory is based by logical derivatoins from heory B. So given that theorzy A is false (maths is a perfect langugae) one cannot add any true logical object, such as theorzy of Goddel of smaller parts, made up of false elements to some extent, one cannot rebuild a new theorzy, having any probability of usuing those false elements from the previous false storz, nor there is no certain way how to judge if someone who chose which are good and true elements, and which are the false ones, how to tell that he, she, it is right ? So this theory cannot be true given A. Given theory B that we know that is false (Conjecture: maths is perfect human language -Refutation: No, there are paradoxes, and even in logic like the Cretan Lier. So building any theory using previous theory as a base, is a perikous endavour.\njak widze ludzi co sie gapia w te telefony to mysle o glonojadach w akwarium przyssanych do szyby\nJak patrze na moje biblioteki, to widze wrote do nieskonczonych universow, tam sa mysle ktore sie przejawialy odkad odkrylismy pierwszse zaspisane artefakty.

If you say, agreeing to somoene saying for instance \u0026lsquo;it is good to think before acting\u0026rsquo;. Now if you concede to this point, saying \u0026lsquo;it is true\u0026rsquo;, you agree with the point without distinguishing any nuance. For example, if you walk in nature and you see a charging bull, it might be a good idea to quickly jump on a nearby tree and think after the fact, not before. So saying it is good to think before acting is not always true, since the difference between life and death is seconds. On the other hand if you say \u0026lsquo;it is not false\u0026rsquo;, you can mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t detect falsity in this statememnt, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it deosn\u0026rsquo;t exist. It is just you are conscisous enough to be aware that you might be wrong, which ultimately leads you to making a better decision, since we cannot be sure of many things in life.

This is flattery in disguise, because if someone comports towards you as a subordinate, it boosts your ego. You might think that this is rather a form of deception ( this fundamentally, morally attitude of servility). When someone is deceived, he does not know that he is deceived at the moment of being deceived. One can only talk about deception in view post factum. One might ( a group, nation ) been deceived without being aware of the process of being deceived ( as this is the very nature of deception itself ). A whole century can pass or more, so that no one living in the deception will ever be aware, since they will pass away before the 100 years revelation date ( unexpected, black swan type event, this revelation is ). Think of blood lettings, lobotomy, belinging that earth is flat, etc. But when one is being flatted by someone’s servility , we know that it’s fake and suspicious, or at least we should, and and being aware of the deception and allowing it to happen nevertheless is weakness of mind. The one who deceives would always be guided by his personal interests unless he is imbecile.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/contact/","title":"Contact","section":"Docs","content":" kamil.szewczyk.p@gmail.com # "}]
