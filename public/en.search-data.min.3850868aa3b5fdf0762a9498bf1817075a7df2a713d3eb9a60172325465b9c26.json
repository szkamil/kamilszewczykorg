[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/agree_or_disagree/my-first-post/","title":"Agree or disagree?","section":"Docs","content":" Two ways to agree # If you talk with someone and you want to express agreement you can say:\nit is not false it is true But it seems saying one or another does not amount to the same thing. If you say, agreeing to someone saying for instance \u0026lsquo;it is good to think before acting\u0026rsquo;. Now if you concede to this point, saying \u0026lsquo;it is true\u0026rsquo;, you agree with the point without distinguishing any nuance. For example, if you walk in nature and you see a charging bull, it might be a good idea to quickly jump on a nearby tree and think after the fact, not before. You basically run on survival instincts and there is no time to think, it\u0026rsquo;s too slow and would cost you your life. This works well in primitive environment where dangers are acute and well visible. So saying it is good to think before acting is not always true, since the difference between life and death is seconds.\nOr it is not false\nOn the other hand if you say \u0026lsquo;it is not false\u0026rsquo;, you can mean that you don\u0026rsquo;t detect falsity in this statement, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, but you are not aware of it. It is just you are conscious enough to be aware that you might be wrong, which ultimately leads you to making a better decision, since we cannot be sure of many things in life. Responding to a conversation in a similar fashion by a hypothetical conversation:\nJohn - It is good to think before acting Mary - It is not false John - It is always true Mary - You cannot know how much you know since you cannot possibly know how much you don\u0026rsquo;t know, you are essentially like an insect with antennas sensing his environment 1 cm ahead, not even aware that you observe him since his complex eyes cannot detect well immovable objects. John - That is a good point, it is not false Mary - Exactly what I mean to say, if you agree to some theory that is not false, means that some part of it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look to you false at a given moment, but that itself can be false. You agree but are aware of the conjectural type of the statement.

Or put a toy car next to real car, or architectural maquette of a building next to real one. You cannot live in the maquette building, you can’t go shopping in toy car, you know the difference, but why everyone , including me, mixes up models ( opinion of a thing vs real qualities that can be objectively measured). Why do we believe in dogmas then ( all sorts of, like economy , psychology, théorie de xyZ….) can be due to the fact it’s complex vs simple ( toy car vs theory of time travel) one easy to imagine the other not - but in primitive environment we didn’t worry about time travel speed. We wanted to survive. Now take this caveman into the Time Machine and tell him to go to work in Wall Street - he would go crazy - but both the caveman and the bankers have the same genes, except that the caveman maybe a lot more smarter then some of them, but that’s for another topic on if humanity gets smarter or not. But caveman would mistrust the maps and models , he would use reality heuristics. We are baffled by the noise like that caveman and make all sorts of mistakes on this complex system.\nWe use maps and models all the time without knowing\nBy maps I mean maps of terrain but also all kinds of mathematical equasions such as Black-Scholes forumula, theory of efficient market, Freud\u0026rsquo;s theories, etc. Basically the world is random and some theories can fit in for some time period by coincidence.\nWhen cycling using a cycling computer with map function, one day a feature appeared where the device started warning of potholes on a roads - which can be useful for road cyclists. But also appeared warning of dense traffic and most bizzarly of a dog in a certain spot. Someone marked on a map that there is a dog, maybe 2 years back, the dog can be dead by now but you still get the warning of a dog in a certain spot. How much our models and maps are similar, we are using some economic previsions yet we don\u0026rsquo;t expect that one day instead of the dog there can be elefant running from the local circus, and in different spot.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/on_servility/my-first-post/","title":"On servility","section":"Docs","content":" Servility is a form of flattery # All flattery is fatal\nThe exaggerated or maybe any for that matter, servility ( shoe licking, subordinance) are the forms of flattery. This is flattery in disguise, because if someone comports towards you as a subordinate, it boosts your ego. You might think that this is rather a form of deception ( this fundamentally, morally attitude of servility). When someone is deceived, he does not know that he is deceived at the moment of being deceived. One can only talk about deception in view post factum. One might ( a group, nation ) been deceived without being aware of the process of being deceived ( as this is the very nature of deception itself ). A whole century can pass or more, so that no one living in the deception will ever be aware, since they will pass away before the 100 years revelation date ( unexpected, black swan type event, this revelation is ). Think of blood lettings, lobotomy, belinging that earth is flat, etc. But when one is being flatted by someone’s servility , we know that it’s fake and suspicious, or at least we should, and and being aware of the deception and allowing it to happen nevertheless is weakness of mind. The one who deceives would always be guided by his personal interests unless he is imbecile.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/contact/","title":"Contact","section":"Docs","content":" kamil.szewczyk.p@gmail.com # "}]
