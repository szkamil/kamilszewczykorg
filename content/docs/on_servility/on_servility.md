# Servility is a form of flattery
**All flattery is fatal**

The exaggerated or maybe any for that matter, servility ( shoe licking, subordinance) are the forms of flattery. This is **flattery in disguise**, because if someone comports towards you as a subordinate, it boosts your ego. You might think that this is rather a form of deception ( this fundamentally, morally attitude of servility). When someone is deceived, he does not know that he is deceived at the moment of being deceived. One can only talk about deception in view post factum. One might ( a group, nation ) been deceived without being aware of the process of being deceived ( as this is the very nature of deception itself ). A whole century can pass or more, so that no one living in the deception will ever be aware, since they will pass away before the 100 years revelation date ( unexpected, black swan type event, this revelation is ). Think of blood lettings, lobotomy, belinging that earth is flat, etc.  But when one is being flatted by someone’s servility , we know that it’s fake and suspicious, or at least we should, and and being aware of  the deception and allowing it to happen nevertheless is weakness of mind. The one who deceives would always be guided by his personal interests unless he is imbecile.
